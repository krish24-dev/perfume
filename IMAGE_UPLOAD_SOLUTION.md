# Image Upload and Display Solution

## Problem
The frontend was experiencing blob URL errors like:
```
blob:http://localhost:8080/ae487e29-3d8f-444d-9ce8-ab4e397c791a:1 Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
```

This happened because:
1. Frontend was sending base64 encoded images to backend
2. Backend was expecting file uploads via multer
3. Images weren't being properly stored and served
4. Frontend was trying to display non-existent blob URLs

## Solution

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Updated Product Controller (`productController.js`)
- Added support for both file uploads and base64 images
- Base64 images are now converted to files and saved in `/uploads` directory
- Images are served via static file serving at `/uploads` endpoint

#### 2. Updated Routes (`products.js`)
- Made image upload optional
- Added file type validation for image uploads

#### 3. Server Configuration (`server.js`)
- Added static file serving for uploaded images: `app.use('/uploads', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'uploads')))`

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Updated Collections Component (`Collections.tsx`)
- Fixed image display to use proper backend URLs: `http://localhost:5000${product.imageUrl}`
- Added proper TypeScript types for form handling
- Improved error handling for image loading

## How It Works Now

1. **Image Upload**: 
   - User selects image file
   - Frontend converts to base64 for preview
   - Sends base64 data to backend

2. **Backend Processing**:
   - Receives base64 image data
   - Converts to file and saves in `/uploads` directory
   - Stores file path in database

3. **Image Display**:
   - Frontend fetches products with image URLs
   - Images are served from backend at `/uploads/filename`
   - No more blob URL errors

## Testing

Run the test script to verify backend functionality:
```bash
cd backend
node test-image-upload.js
```

## File Structure
```
backend/
├── uploads/           # Image storage directory
├── controllers/
│   └── productController.js  # Handles base64 conversion
├── routes/
│   └── products.js           # Optional image uploads
└── server.js                 # Static file serving
```

## Benefits
- ✅ No more blob URL errors
- ✅ Images are properly stored and served
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Type-safe frontend code
- ✅ Scalable image storage solution
